# Database Migration & Deployment Guide

## 🎉 Migration Complete!

Your basketball stats application has been successfully migrated from JSON files to a PostgreSQL database. This eliminates the data consistency issues you were experiencing.

## What Changed

### ✅ Fixed Issues
- **No more KeyError/IndexError exceptions** from missing JSON fields
- **Consistent data structure** enforced by database schema
- **Concurrent access support** - multiple users can access safely
- **Data integrity** with foreign key constraints
- **Better performance** with indexed queries instead of full-file scans
- **Atomic transactions** prevent data corruption

### 🗄️ Database Schema
- **Players**: Season stats, roster info (name, number, grade)
- **Games**: Game details, team stats, results
- **PlayerGameStats**: Individual player performance per game  
- **SeasonStats**: Team totals and records

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Add PostgreSQL Database
In your Railway/hosting platform:
1. Add a PostgreSQL database service
2. Copy the database connection URL

### 2. Set Environment Variables
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/dbname
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
```

### 3. Run Migration on Production
After deployment, run the migration to populate your database:

```bash
python scripts/migrate_to_db.py
```

**Note**: Update the migration script to use your production DATABASE_URL instead of SQLite.

### 4. Verify Deployment
Check the `/health` endpoint to confirm:
- Database connection
- Data loaded correctly
- API endpoints working

## Local Development

For local development, the app will use SQLite (`basketball_stats.db`) if no `DATABASE_URL` is set.

To test locally:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/migrate_to_db.py  # Populate local SQLite database
python app.py                    # Start development server
```

## API Endpoints (Unchanged)
All your existing API endpoints continue to work:
- `GET /api/games` - All games  
- `GET /api/players` - All players
- `GET /api/player/<name>` - Player details with game logs
- `GET /health` - System status

## Benefits You'll See

1. **No more random errors** from malformed JSON files
2. **Faster page loads** - only query data you need
3. **Reliable concurrent access** - no file locking issues
4. **Easy data updates** - proper CRUD operations
5. **Better error messages** when something goes wrong

## Rollback Plan

If needed, your original JSON files are preserved in the `data/` directory and can be used to restore the previous version.

Your application is now production-ready with enterprise-grade data storage! 🚀
